# TextEdit API
 
## What is it?
A simple API to edit certain text in various ways. For example, making text go backwards or upsidedown and much more!

## How do I use it?
1. Download the code/clone the repository into a directory 
2. Make sure nodejs is installed and up to date
3. Open the directory with a terminal and type `node index.js`
4. Open a browser and go to the url: localhost:3000 
5. Go wild

## Is it finished?
No. I still need to finish the main page (which is basically just the documentation) and add a few more features.
